# Outlaw

A PHP library helping implement CRUD in a dirty and fast way.

## The Outlaw says:
> Sometimes after you implemented html and css, you hope your application is finished.
> Unfortunately, you still need to make migrations, build models, pass parameters in controller, and etc.
> I help solving this in a dirty and fast way.

## Goals
* Enable developers to define the database schema in HTML.
* No need to make migrations. The Outlaw builds the table automatically.
* No need to pass parameters in controller. The Outlaw use $_GET, $_POST, and $_REQUEST directly.
* No need to implement models. The Outlaw provides basic CRUD for you.

## Rules
* Prefix every html input fields name the Outlaw needed with 'ol_'
* You only need to pass the table name and primary key in the controller if needed, all the other parameters the outlaw will handle.

## Warning
This library should **only** be used for **insensitive applications** or **prototyping new ideas**.
It's very fast but really dirty.
Use it carefully.

## Getting Started

Let's say, you need a blogging system.

In config file, set database name and password.
```php
// config.php

$config['database'] = array(
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=koala',
    'user' => 'koala',
    'password' => 'koala'
);
```

### Create

First we need a place to create articles.
We need two fields 'title' and 'content'.

```html
<form action='/blog/create' method='post'>
    Title: <input type='text' name='ol_title' />
    Content: <input type='text' name='ol_content' />
    <input type='submit' value='SEND' />
</form>
```

And then tell the outlaw where to **create** the data in the blog controller.
```php
function __construct(){
    $this->ol = new Outlaw();
}

public function create()
{
    $this->ol->create('articles');
}    
```
Now check your database, the 'articles' table is created, and you just inserted one row into it!

### Read

We also need a place to see all the articles.
Let's **readAll** them first.
```php
public function index(){
    $this->data['articles'] = $this->ol->readAll('articles');
    $this->template->build('product/index', $this->data);
}
```

So you can use them.
```php
<?php foreach($articles as $a): ?>
    <?php echo $a->title ?>
    <?php echo $a->content ?>
<?php endforeach; ?>
```
To view a single article, tell the outlaw the table name and id to **read** it.
```php
function view($id){
    $this->data['article'] = $this->ol->read('articles', $id);
    $this->template->build('demo/view', $this->data);        
}
```

### Update

To edit an article, tell the outlaw the table name and id to **update** it.
```php
function update(){
    $id = $_POST['ol_id'];
    $this->ol->update('articles', $id))
    redirect('/blog/view/' . $id);
}
```

### Delete

To delete an article, tell the outlaw the table name and id so outlaw can know who to **delete**.
```php
function delete(){
    $id = $_REQUEST['id'];
    $this->ol->delete('articles', $id);
    redirect('/blog');
}
```

### Upload File
Set the upload path in config.php.
```php
$config['upload_path'] = './upload/';             
        
```

Then in the html:

```html
<label>Person</label>
<input type="file" name='ol_person'>

<label>Logo</label>
<input type="file" name='ol_logo'>
```

Outlaw will rename the files, store them in the path, and save the file name in attributes after **create**.

For instance, we could show the above files like this:

```php
    <img src='/upload/<?php echo $article->person ?>' />    
    <img src='/upload/<?php echo $article->logo ?>' />    
```

## Validation
Validating with Valitron:

https://github.com/vlucas/valitron

```php
// Set all the fields and table in config file.
$config['rules'] = array(
    'articles' => array(
        // notice the attribute is wrapped in an array even it's just a string
        'required' => [['ol_title'], ['ol_content']],
        'lengthMin' => [['ol_title', 5], ['ol_content', 10]]
    ),
    'stores' => [
        'required' => [ ['ol_name'], ['ol_boss'], ['ol_phone'], ['ol_address'] ]
    ]
);
```
It utilize in **create** and **update** method.
If fail to pass validation, they return false. 
And you can get validation error message by getErrors methd.
```php
      if ($this->ol->update('articles', $id)){
          redirect('/demo/view/' . $id);
      }
      else{
          exit(var_export($this->ol->getErrors()));
      }

```

## One-to-many Relationship
Let's say you want to assign an author for the article.
The user has an id value of '5' in 'users' table.
```html
<form action='/blog/create' method='post'>
    <input type='hidden' name='ol_belong_users' value='5'>
    Title: <input type='text' name='ol_title' />
    Content: <input type='text' name='ol_content' />
    <input type='submit' value='SEND' />
</form>
```
* prefix with ol_belong_
* followed by the table name
* set value as the id of the parent

Then you can utilize the relationship as this(notice the **ownArticles** attributes created by the outlaw):
```php
// child to parent
// Notice it's defined by the table name. 
// Although you think 'user' is better than 'users'.
echo $article->users->name;

// parent to children
$user = $ol->read('users', '5');
foreach ($user->ownArticles as $article){
    echo $article->title;
}
```

## Upload Multiple Files

Add 'multiple' attribute and '[]' to the name:

```html
<label>Photos</label>
<input type="file" name='ol_photos[]' multiple>
```
Because it's no longer one-to-one relationship, so we cannot use the same table.
Outlaw will create a 'photos' table, which only contains 'id', 'name', and 'articles_id' as foreign key.

And the usage becomes:
```php
<?php foreach($article->ownPhotos as $photo): ?>
    <img src='/upload/<?php echo $photo->name ?>' />    
<?php endforeach; ?>
```

## Singleton Data

Sometimes we need tables that will always have only one row in it.
For example, contact information, website settings, and etc.
We don't really need complete CRUD for this since we will never delete it or insert new row.

Outlaw solve this with singleton data.
In config file, set the **singleton_data** index with table structure and default value:

```php
$config['singleton_data'] = array(
    'site' => array(
        'name' => 'Kelly',
        'contact' => 'Hi, I am Kelly'
    )
);
```
Outlaw will create the 'site' table with two fields 'name' and 'contact', inserting the row with default value while initializing.

You can get the singleton data with **readSingleton** method:

```php
    $this->data['site'] = $this->ol->readSingleton('site');
    $this->template->build('admin/edit_contact', $this->data);        
```
And update the singleton data with the same rules for basic CRUD operations with **updateSingleton** method:
```php
    $this->ol->updateSingleton('site')
```

## User Authentication
Sometimes we just want to have a simple and fast way to protect certian pages. 

We don't want to implement password hash procedure, member system and even the views for login and register since there's even only one admin user will need to login the application!

Set the 'auth' with user name and password:
```php
$config['auth'] = array(
    'user' => 'kelly',
    'password' => 'kelly123'
);
```
And call the **protect** method in the pages you want to protect.
Outlaw will render a simple view with input fields to ask users login.

```php
    $this->ol->protect();
```

## Helper Functions

Outlaw is built-in with some global functions.

Create a html button to allow sending http POST requests.
```php
button_to($html_class, $url, $data, $label, $confirm_msg)
```
Create a html hidden input. Just to type less characters.
```php
hidden($name, $value)
```
Check the content of variables. Debugging purpose.
```php
look($v)
```
Transform the raw string with proper html format like break line to 'br tag', space to '&nsbp'.., and etc.
```php
 typography($string)
```

## Reserved Words in html input name
* ol_belong_*

## Design Principle
* Type as less characters as possible.

## API
* create ($table_name)

> Insert other $_REQUEST parameters prefixed with 'ol_' into $table_name.

* read ($table_name, $id)

> Fetch one single row.

* update ($table_name, $id)

> Update one single row.

* delete ($table_name, $id)

> Delete one row.

* readAll ($table_name)

> Get all the rows.

* getErrors()

> Get error messages about validation failure.

* readSingleton($tableName)

> Read the only one row from the table.

* updateSingleton($tableName)

> Update the only one row from the table.

* protect()

> Protect the certain pages and ask users for name/password.

## Technical Detail
* Manipulate the database with Redbeanphp 3.5

http://redbeanphp.com/manual3_0/quick_tour

That's why the Outlaw doesn't need migrations or existing tables.

* Validating with Valitron 1.1.7

https://github.com/vlucas/valitron

* Using $_REQUEST array in PHP directly, so you can pass variable either by GET or POST or even COOKIE.

## Todo

* Many-to-many relationship

* More security maybe ...

* Remove the files if it's overwritten
